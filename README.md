# Starter-Kit-2018


So I built this for all the new web developers... My Goal is to save you time from the bullsh*t of spending hours looking for ways to speed up your learning. Sometimes all we want to do is just code.
(if you are coming from my  [youtube channel CodingPhase ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC46wWUso9H5KPQcoL9iE3Ug) I will base all my tutorials from this starter kit)

I broke it down in simple steps to get you going.
